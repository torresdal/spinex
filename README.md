# Spinex - A Spinnaker CLI

## Why Spinex?

Spinnaker is of course the biggest downwind sail for a sailboat, so I thought what from sailing can I use for naming this CLI? One of the things I have on my wish list for my sailboat is a Spinex for my asymetrical spinnaker (or gennaker). A Spinex is basically a furler that extremely simplifies furling and unfurling of your genaker. It is similar to a Furlex which is quite common to use for the genoa (front sail/jib).
